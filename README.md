### Dali Application API Challenge ###
This is a simple Python script that reads the Weather from the OpenWeatherMap API and tweets weather updates (@WeatherGuy8) through the Twitter API.

The script can be altered to report weather from different locations by changing only one variable (`city_id`).

The script would be best used on a schedule so that weather updates could be tweeted hourly, daily, etc.
