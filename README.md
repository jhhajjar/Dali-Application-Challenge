# Dali Application API Challenge
This is a simple Python script that reads the Weather from the OpenWeatherMap API and tweets weather updates (https://twitter.com/WeatherGuy8) through the Twitter API.

### Flexibility ###
The script can be altered to report weather from different locations by changing only one variable (`city_id`). It would be best used on a schedule so that weather updates could be tweeted hourly, daily, etc.

### Usability ###
The script will not work as it is written right now. The API keys necessary for it to work have been left out for the sake of privacy.
